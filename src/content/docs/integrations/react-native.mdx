In React Native, MSW works similarly to Node.js, but omits certain request interceptors for modules that are not present in React Native, like the standard `http` module in Node.js.

<Warning>
  **This integration is potentially incomplete**. If you are a React Native
  developer, please follow these steps and share any discrepancies/missing
  pieces with us on [GitHub](https://github.com/mswjs/mswjs.io/issues). Let's
  improve the React Native integration guidelines together.
</Warning>

## Prerequisites

### Polyfills

MSW relies on standard JavaScript classes that are not present in React Native, like `URL`. Please install the polyfills below to guarantee proper MSW execution in React Native.

```sh
npm install react-native-url-polyfill fast-text-encoding
```

Create a new `msw.polyfills.js` file with the following content:

```js
// msw.polyfills.js
import "fast-text-encoding";
import "react-native-url-polyfill/auto";
```

We will import this file later, when [Enabling mocking](#enable-mocking).

## Setup

Import the `setupServer` function from `msw/native` and call it, providing your request handlers as the argument.

```js {2}
// src/mocks/server.js
import { setupServer } from "msw/native";
import { handlers } from "./handlers";

export const server = setupServer(...handlers);
```

> Learn more about the [`setupServer` API](/docs/api/setup-server). It's the same for Node.js and React Native.

<Warning>
  In React Native, import `setupServer` from `msw/native`. The `/native` export
  contains pre-configured interceptors relevant for the React Native
  environment.
</Warning>

## Enable mocking

### Development

Import `server` in the entrypoint of your React Native application and call `server.listen()` _conditionally_.

```js {6-14} /enableMocking/
// index.js
import { AppRegistry } from "react-native";
import App from "./src/App";
import { name as appName } from "./app.json";

async function enableMocking() {
  if (!__DEV__) {
    return;
  }

  await import("./msw.polyfills");
  const { server } = await import("./src/mocks/server");
  server.listen();
}

enableMocking().then(() => {
  AppRegistry.registerComponent(appName, () => App);
});
```

> Don't forget to import the `msw.polyfills.js` module!

### Testing

When testing your React Native application, the way you set up MSW will differ based on how you run your tests. For example, for unit/integration testing where you render your React components in isolation, you should follow the regular [Node.js integration](/docs/integrations/node) to configure MSW with tools like Vitest or Jest.

For end-to-end testing, make sure you have [Enabled MSW in development](#development) and spawn the instance of your React Native application accordingly (feel free to introduce new environment variables just for that). That way, you will be running your end-to-end tests against the application instance that has MSW up and running.

## Common issues

### Unable to resolve module `http`

**Reason:** Your React Native code ends up importing the `http` module that doesn't exist in React Native.

**Solution:** Find the incorrect `msw/node` import in your application and replace it with `msw/native`.

```diff /native/
-import { setupServer } from 'msw/node'
+import { setupServer } from 'msw/native'
```

### Network request fails with `TypeError: Failed to fetch`

**Reason:** `/node_modules/@mswjs/interceptors/src/interceptors/fetch/index.ts` throws at `createNetworkError` because your `Node` version is not `≥18.17`

**Solution:** Upgrade your Node version to `≥18.17`.
